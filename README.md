## üß™ How to Run

### 1. Start the server:

Run from the project root so imports and relative paths work correctly:

```bash
# activate your venv first (if you made one at the project root)
source .venv/bin/activate

# start the TCP server (example defaults)
python3 server/tcp_server.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --questions questions/sample_questions.json
```

### 2. Run the client (in separate terminals or machines):

From the project root (with the venv activated):

```bash
streamlit run client/streamlit_app.py
```

### 3. Join using IP and port prompted in the UI

# üß© CS411 ‚Äì Lab 4 Mini Project: TCP Online Quiz Game

**Course:** CS411 ‚Äî Computer Networks  
**Instructor:** M. Iheb Hergli  
**Team Size:** 4 members  
**Project Type:** Mini project (counts as *two* labs)  
**LAN Ports:** Server `8888` (TCP), Streamlit `8501`  
**Submission:** `lab4.zip` (includes code + 3‚Äì5 page report + optional slides)

---

## üéØ Goal

Implement a **multiplayer quiz game** over **TCP** with a **Streamlit** client, demonstrating:
- reliable, ordered delivery and multi-client synchronization
- server-side timers and **first-correct** scoring
- clean teamwork & engineering practices suitable for a lab demo

---

## üó∫Ô∏è System Overview (aligned to your diagrams)

### Actors & Use Cases

- **Client Player**
  - Connect to server
  - Provide unique username
  - Listen for questions
  - Submit answers (within timer)
  - View feedback & score
  - View leaderboard

- **Server Admin**
  - Start a game round
  - Broadcast questions
  - Set time limits (e.g., 30s)
  - Display end-of-round scores

### End-to-End Flow (Sequence)

1. **Game Initialization**
   - Admin starts round
   - Server **broadcasts question**
   - Server **starts timer** (e.g., 30s)

2. **Players Answer**
   - Clients submit answers
   - Server **checks** each answer
   - Only **first correct** earns points for that question

3. **Feedback to Players**
   - Server sends **correct/wrong** result per player
   - Server updates & **broadcasts leaderboard**
   - Loop for next question ‚Ä¶ until round ends

> The server **never blocks** on a single client; disconnects or slow clients don‚Äôt stall the round.

---

## üß† Architecture

### Components

- **Server (TCP, port 8888)**
  - Accept loop (main thread)
  - **Client handler threads** (read LD-JSON, enqueue answers)
  - **Coordinator thread** (broadcast Qs, run timers, score, publish feedback/leaderboard)
  - Shared state guarded by locks: `clients`, `scores`, `current_question_id`, `answered_this_q`

- **Client**
  - TCP socket to server
  - Streamlit UI in `app.py` (username, question view, countdown, leaderboard)

### Message Protocol (LD-JSON over TCP)

TCP is a stream; messages are **newline-delimited JSON** (UTF-8):

```json
{"type":"join","username":"fares"}
{"type":"question","id":7,"text":"Which port is HTTPS?","options":["80","21","25","443"],"deadline_ms":30000}
{"type":"answer","username":"fares","question_id":7,"answer":"443","ts":1730}
{"type":"feedback","username":"fares","correct":true}
{"type":"score","leaderboard":[["fares",3],["ines",2],["youssef",1]]}
{"type":"broadcast","message":"Time is up! Correct answer: 443"}
{"type":"error","code":"BAD_FORMAT","detail":"missing field 'answer'"}

## üß† System Design

### High-Level Architecture
- **Server (TCP, port 8888)**  
  - Accepts clients; spawns **one thread per client**.  
  - Broadcasts questions; enforces **per-question deadline** (e.g., 30s).  
  - Scores **first correct** answer; broadcasts leaderboard.  
  - Handles malformed input and disconnects gracefully. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

- **Client (TCP) + Streamlit GUI (port 8501)**  
  - Connects with a **unique username**.  
  - Displays question + options + countdown.  
  - Sends answer; shows correctness and leaderboard. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Message Format (JSON over TCP)
All frames are **newline-delimited JSON** (LD-JSON) to preserve message boundaries:

```json
{"type":"join","username":"fares"}
{"type":"question","id":3,"text":"Default TCP port for HTTP?","options":["80","8080","21","25"],"deadline_ms":30000}
{"type":"answer","username":"fares","question_id":3,"answer":"80","ts":1730}
{"type":"score","leaderboard":[["fares",3],["ines",2],["youssef",1]]}
{"type":"broadcast","message":"Time is up! Correct: 80"}
{"type":"ack","ok":true}
{"type":"error","code":"BAD_FORMAT","detail":"Missing field 'answer'"}
````

**Why LD-JSON?**

* TCP is a stream; **newline** acts as a clear delimiter.
* JSON is human-readable, UTF-8, and easy to debug.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

```bash
# 1) Clone & enter
git clone <your_repo_url> quiznet-tcp-udp
cd quiznet-tcp-udp

# 2) Python env
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3) Deps
pip install streamlit
# (Add more deps if you use logging/typing extras)

# 4) Author questions
cp sample_questions.txt questions.txt   # or create your own 10 Qs
```

> Work on the **same LAN** (Wi-Fi or wired). Open ports **8888** and **8501** in your OS firewall if needed. Remote work is not permitted per lab rules. 

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running

**Terminal 1 ‚Äì Server**

```bash
cd tcp_quiz
python server_tcp.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --questions ../questions.txt --qtime 30
```

**Terminal 2..N ‚Äì Clients (CLI for debugging)**

```bash
cd tcp_quiz
python client_tcp.py --host <SERVER_LAN_IP> --port 8888 --username <name>
```

**Streamlit GUI**

```bash
streamlit run app.py   # opens http://localhost:8501 (or http://<LAN IP>:8501)
```

---

## üß© Core Game Logic

1. **Join**: client sends `join` ‚Üí server registers username.
2. **Broadcast question**: includes `deadline_ms`.
3. **Answer window**: server accepts answers; **first correct** gets points.
4. **Timeout**: server reveals correct answer; emits `score`.
5. **Round advance**: repeat for 5‚Äì10 questions; end with final leaderboard. 

---

## üßµ Concurrency & Reliability (TCP)

* **Server**

  * Main thread: `accept()` loop.
  * Client handler thread: read LD-JSON, validate, enqueue answers.
  * **Coordinator** (server control thread): broadcasts questions, times deadlines, awards points, publishes scores.
* **Thread Safety**

  * Guard shared state (`clients`, `scores`, `current_question_id`, `answered`) with `threading.Lock()`.
* **Backpressure & Robustness**

  * Non-blocking send with short timeouts; if a client is slow, **skip** rather than stall the round.
  * On socket error: **remove client**, continue the game.

* **Mid-week integration test** on LAN.
* **End-week demo rehearsal**.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Checklist

* **Networking**

  * Use **newline-delimited JSON**; validate fields.
  * Set socket timeouts; catch `ConnectionResetError`, `BrokenPipeError`.
* **Timing & Scoring**

  * Server-side authoritative timer; ignore late answers.
  * Track **first-correct** via an atomic flag/lock.
* **Threading**

  * Shared structures behind locks; avoid long holds.
  * Never block the coordinator on a single slow client send.
* **GUI**

  * Keep socket I/O off the main Streamlit thread (thread or async wrapper).
  * Use `st.session_state` for username, connection, and last leaderboard.
* **Code Quality**

  * PEP8, type hints, docstrings for public functions.
  * Centralize constants (`PORT`, `QTIME`, message keys).
* **Observability**

  * Structured logs: `INFO` (joins, broadcasts), `WARN` (slow client), `ERROR` (disconnects).
  * Debug flag to dump wire messages when needed.
* **Data**

  * Externalize `questions.txt`; validate it at server start.

---

## üß™ Quick Self-Test (before submission)

* [ ] 3 clients + GUI can join and play a full round
* [ ] First-correct scoring proven with simultaneous answers
* [ ] Timeout reveals correct answer and advances round
* [ ] Disconnect doesn‚Äôt crash server or stall round
* [ ] Screenshots for all scenarios added to `report.pdf`
* [ ] Ports 8888 and 8501 open; LAN IPs confirmed
* [ ] `lab4.zip` contains all required files

---

## üéÅ Bonus Ideas (+5%)

* Per-question **countdown UI** with progress bar.
* **Chat** broadcast channel.
* Persistent **leaderboard history** (JSON/CSV).
* Simple **auth** or nickname reservation.

---

## üîê Academic Integrity

All work must be **original**; discussion allowed, but **no identical code**. Include **individual contributions** in the report; absence on demo day penalizes grade (√∑2). 

---

## üôè Acknowledgment

This README aligns with the **CS411 Lab 4** instructions (Mediterranean Institute of Technology) for weeks 8‚Äì10, deliverables, ports, GUI requirement, grading, and test scenarios. 

```

If you want, I can also generate minimal, production-ready **starter templates** for `server_tcp.py`, `client_tcp.py`, and `app.py` that follow this roadmap (LD-JSON framing, locks, timers, and a clean Streamlit layout).
```
